title: "We're on TOR!"
---

Keeping within the theme of being as sovereign/independent as possible, I've decided to experiment with torifying this site.

The tor site is self hosted on a cheap Raspberry PI zero (minimal computing and power resources) where I'm currently located.

That way in case **nolim1t.co** were not to be made available, there would be a fallback.

The TOR address is **nlboxajljr5boevw3vyfryenhwqs5eehfh5pnbzjlnounrje5wulbnyd.onion**, you can also use this address to grab the latest [PGP Key](http://nlboxajljr5boevw3vyfryenhwqs5eehfh5pnbzjlnounrje5wulbnyd.onion/key/pgpkey.asc.txt) deployed.

Eventually I'd like to add more TOR backend type services here as well.

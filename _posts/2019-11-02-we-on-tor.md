title: "We're on TOR!"

Keeping within the theme of being as sovereign/independent as possible, I've decided to experiment with torifying this site.

## The nitty gritty

The tor site is self hosted on a cheap Raspberry PI zero (minimal computing and power resources) where I'm currently located. 

Tor is very handy because you don't need to expose your IP address, therefore giving away potential information on yourself.

I've also taken advantage of [Github Actions](https://github.com/actions) to auto-magically deploy too.

## Reasoning

That way in case **nolim1t.co** were not to be made available, there would be a fallback site. 

The first experimental TOR address is [**nlboxajljr5boevw3vyfryenhwqs5eehfh5pnbzjlnounrje5wulbnyd.onion**](http://nlboxajljr5boevw3vyfryenhwqs5eehfh5pnbzjlnounrje5wulbnyd.onion) (Requires TOR enabled browser), you can also use this address to grab the latest [PGP Key](http://nlboxajljr5boevw3vyfryenhwqs5eehfh5pnbzjlnounrje5wulbnyd.onion/key/pgpkey.asc.txt) deployed.

I plan on setting up another TOR address for redundancy using another cheap raspberry pi zero (they cost like $10-15 !)

Eventually I'd like to add more TOR backend type services here as well, also TOR only exclusives too.


## Auto-deployment

I've got an auto-deployment script set up which listens on Github for new commits and  pushes it to TOR.

Please take a look at [this github action](https://github.com/nolim1t/actions/tree/master/torscp) if you would like to deploy your own TOR site via SCP, or suggest any changes if you find any issues.

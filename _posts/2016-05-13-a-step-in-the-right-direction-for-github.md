Recently there was [a post](https://github.com/blog/2164-introducing-unlimited-private-repositories) about unlimited repositories for private accounts, and instead of paying per repository for organizations, it's now a per seat price.

For private users this is a good thing. For a flat price they can create as many repositories as possible..

For organizational users, the only thing that may suffer is that if the organization has inactive users they may want to delete people who no longer need access. But at least it gives them a chance to review who has access and who doesnt. They do have the option to continue along the old plan though at least.

What do you think about the changes?

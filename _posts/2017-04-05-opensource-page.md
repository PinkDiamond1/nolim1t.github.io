As a big sharer I am, my github is full of both old, experimental, and new projects. I think it's a good thing to document everything - particularly if it's to further your professional career.

So I've decided to start an [**open source listing page**](http://nolim1t.co/opensource) where all my open source libraries (for now just NPM and Ruby Gems) are showcased.

Stay tuned for more additions, as I love how github pages actually lets you structure the projects in a way that you can create different git repositories for different things (so the main page doesn't get too cluttered).

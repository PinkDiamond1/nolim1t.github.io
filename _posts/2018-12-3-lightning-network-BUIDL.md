title: "Lightning Network BUIDL time"
---

The crypto bear markets of 2018 is an excuse to hunker down while not traveling and BUIDL stuff.

I've been lately collaborating on a project similar to the RaspiBlitz project to make bitcoin and lightning network more accessible to anyone.

And also it's awesome to be an early pre-cursor to bitcoin layer 2 technology.

For those who want to open some channels, try the following nodes (basically the same LND)

* **IPv4 Connection String** ([Scan QR code here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83470/47255967-9981a100-d4a2-11e8-9e82-ad1229f2160e.png)) ([1ML](https://1ml.com/node/0207e84c3f26846744509c76cdd8215119d88e4e07b8f885f3657025fcb49bb728)) ```0207e84c3f26846744509c76cdd8215119d88e4e07b8f885f3657025fcb49bb728@reckless.nolim1t.co:9739```

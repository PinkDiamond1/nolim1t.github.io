Lots of stuff has happened lately.

* Experimenting with different blogging platforms (I think this one wins because there is less messing around)
* Experimenting and failing (learning) on different startups
* Experimenting with different technologies
* Being more transparent with what I'm doing (see all those small node.js libraries I've created)
* Doing freelance mobile development
* Dabbling in UX (have 2 UX clients as of this year) and seem to be loving it (mainly because people actually "get it")
* Researching company incorporation (HK could be nice)

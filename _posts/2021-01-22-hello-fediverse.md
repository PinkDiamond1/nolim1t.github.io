As part of the [decentralization effort](https://nolim1t.co/2021/01/11/new-era-has-begin.html) I've moved off [bitcoinhackers](https://bitcoinhackers.org/@nolim1t) and onto [my own instance](https://social.nolim1t.co/@nolim1t), therefore taking the first step to owning my own content that I put out.

Also not having to self-censor is a good thing too. A plus is no ads.

To achieve this, I used a service called [Bitvps](http://bitvps.com/) which lets you rent out instances by the hour / day / week. Without an account, or doxxing yourself on a customer database. Its a risk that you might lose the server details, but I think its a good proof of life thing too. Should the profile disappear, it also acts as a dead mans switch too.

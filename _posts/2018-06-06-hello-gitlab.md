title: "Hello GitLab!"

After hearing some news upon GitHub being acquired, it's time to spread my wings and move somewhere else.

I've always wanted to try out GitLab these days anyway but the recent acquisition has made me make up my mind.

The other alternative would be BitBucket, however the [UX isn't so great](https://twitter.com/nolim1t/status/900298764874792960) - especially for pull requests, if you look at that tweet replies even the [Atlassian UX guy agreed with me](https://twitter.com/erikvanzijst/status/900736487762804737) there.

Anyway GitLab has a cool CI/CD feature which means you don't need travisCI at all and includes private repos in the price.

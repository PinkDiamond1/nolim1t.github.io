title: "Jekyll as a blog platform"
---

After about 5 years of first experimenting with Jekyll and about a year of using jekyll (and github pages) for a blog platform over "traditional" platforms such as Wordpress (or maybe KeystoneJS) here are my key points. Disclaimer that I'm not an expert yet, but know enough how to get things done.

## What I like
* Static pages so it's fast as your server is.
* Very easy to make posts. Just open up an editor and type away. Blog like a hacker.
* On the post editing side, using github pages lets you version control changes and edit pages using the web editor (maybe branching might be useful for previewing blog posts too)
* Jekyll is open source and has a lot of [plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/).
* While we are on the subject of plugins, [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2jekyll/) has a plugin which lets you post to this plug too.
* You can even use [RSS Feeds](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) inside jekyll or if you got enough posts you can use [pagination](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate) (Note that this particular gem seems to be deprecated as the latest jekyll has it implemented)
* Everything is version controlled and portable

## Dislikes so far
Not so much, but
* SSL support for github pages (I hope they will come up with a solution soon). This is platform specific.

But in conclusion, I think that I'll try to move some of my other blog  across to this platform and see how it works out.

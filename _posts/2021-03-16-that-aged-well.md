title: "That aged well - Mastodon self-host retrospective"
---

Hey I'm still alive!

Well end of an era for my extremely [short lived mastodon instance](https://nolim1t.co/2021/01/22/hello-fediverse.html) on **social.nolim1t.co**.

It was great to host and be self sovereign, however I hosted it on a accountless VPS called bitvps. 

It was great until you ran into issues. Where then you couldn't get any support (what a surprise).

The issue I had was there was no way of resetting this after I selected a payment method that I made a mistake with.

Anyway, I still have my [warrant canary](https://nolim1t.co/canary.txt) that you can easily verify. And for my actual mastodon accounts, you may find my [social media](https://nolim1t.co/socialmedia.txt) listings on this site. 

Luckily mastodon follows can be migrated. I'm over at bitcoinhackers.org again.

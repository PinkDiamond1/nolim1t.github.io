I wanted to add some dynamic stuff to this blog. At first I thought Angular, but then the setup process seems a bit harder.

But I settled on React (only because I want to do a React Native project.. Baby steps!). I've never used react before but it seems quite easy to implement. A bonus is that each section for the site seems to be able to be mapped to a class, rather than mapping the whole view to a controller.

I guess if you still like having everything on a controller, then use react, but if you want to split up the DOM components into each class you should use react.

It's still early days anyway.

And next step is to get rid of all that cloudflare code (because Cloudflare doesn't work properly in mainland China, I'd like to get some Mainland china readership here too)

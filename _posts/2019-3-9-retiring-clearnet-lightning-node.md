title: "Retiring clearnet lightning node for TOR"
---

Because of the issue behind firewalls, changing IPs, and relying on tunnelling services for operations of my lightning node, I have decided to retire the clearnet endpoint for it.

Reason being is the following:

* **Nomadic Lifestyle** - I'm nomadic by nature (few months in one place, few months in another). Tor networking fits the bill a bit better as in there is a fixed address that works all the time.
* **Privacy / Better Personal Sovereignity** - Not being associated with a single IP address or sovereign nation is great. The sovereignity I value more. This falls into the nomadic lifestyle part about moving around wherevers good right now (weather wise), and taking in whats great about a particularly location.
* **Having a fixed address / Reliable networking** - Having a reliable networking environment improves peoples connectivity.
* **Supporting the TOR Node community** - Theres not too many tor nodes out there. So I'm doing my part. I'll be also still contributing to [LNCM Projects](https://github.com/lncm) as well, so will be supporting TOR stuff. 

Anyway for those who want to tune in to my nodes check out my nodes [1Ml.com](https://1ml.com/node/030a97ec5d3b3be3cc825838f49c73ca543eec0c8e4d528ac6371b3ba131ea2d4a) profile or at the command line open a channel to one of the following:


### Nodes

#### The Box Archival

This node is running the [lncm](https://lncm.io/) BOX software, but instead of 3 usb sticks, I've replaced one with a HDD (for the full blockchain rather than pruned).

### For Node support



For support, lets say you want me to close your channel, feel free to reach out to me on Telegram/Wire Messenger/Twitter with the username @nolim1t or mastodon on nolim1t@bitcoinhackers.org , or you can [open a ticket on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/nolim1t-co/issues/new) with your concerns. Don't forget to specify which node you used and where.

Also if you do open a channel to me, appreciate that you make yourself known so I can reciprocate, and also would be great to know whos behind the node (if I need you to close the channel too)

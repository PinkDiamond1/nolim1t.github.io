title: "New year, New Things!"
---

Well, well well - it's been a long time since the last update. 

### A lot of things has happened in the last 3 months.

* First things first, Christmas again in Hong Kong (love it). 
* Followed by New Years Eve in Korea
* Then back to Taiwan in the beginning of the year for a little to get some business sorted out
* Then powering on to HK for startup weekend, and startmeupfestival.
* As a result of a very successful startup weekend, a [Vaultarch](https://vaultarch.com) was born. A secure platform for detecting counterfeits through imaging. We've pivoted a few times due to demand, but I think we are settling down in the  area where we are doing provenance.
 

### As a result of winning startup weekend
* Launch IoT (although I could have gotten a free ticket anyway). Lots of good connections including meeting a friend of a friend coming from Malaysia (will visit next week). And another travelpreneur friend of mine from Korea (also going to catch up soon - so far with met in 3 different cities!).
* Meeting some more ppl at startup weekend

### Chinese New Year
* Chinese New Year for the first time in Hong Kong was a blast. Met a **TON** of connections from Hong Kong and abroad. This is going to make it hard to leave soon.
* A nice short break too, and got to experience the local culture
 
### As a result of winning startup weekend
* Being pitched many ideas (thanks to startupweekend)
* Work Work Work on making the startup weekend project a reality. And ended up staying in Hong Kong longer than anticipated (missed out on this years Sydney Mardi Gras, and SXSW 2016). Always next year though I hope.
 
### Other stuff
* Friend of Friend development leads are starting to pay off with referrals.
* Kicked off startup weekend in Shenzhen
* Passive income for some past projects trickling in (after some big projects funding dried up)
* Converting my bitcoin exchange API bindings to ruby gems
* Amazon Lambda and OpenCV
* Amazon Lambda in general (and trying to focus on static sites with javascript microservices)

### And now for the latest project
Which I might add, should interest nomads - [Where was I in the last 90 days](http://static.barryteoh.com/travel-stats.html) 

Sounds good? It's sure a rollercoaster - just like the prices of bitcoin.

### Future
* Kicking off another passive income project in Taipei soon. This will hopefully match the same income I've had. Only that I don't have to do much but actually focus on new stuff.
* Funnelling funds into my current startup (and other startups)
* RISE
* Hopefully a new Hong Kong visa in the future (It's been an awesome 1 1/2 years. I feel like I need to stay for more)

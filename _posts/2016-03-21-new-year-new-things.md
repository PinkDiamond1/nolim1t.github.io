title: "New year, New Things!"
---

Well, well well - it's been a long time since the last update. 

## A lot of things has happened in the last 3 months.

* First things first, Christmas again in Hong Kong (love it). 
* Followed by New Years Eve in Korea
* Then back to Taiwan in the beginning of the year for a little to get some business sorted out
* Then powering on to HK for startup weekend, and startmeupfestival.
* As a result of a very successful startup weekend, a [Vaultarch](https://vaultarch.com) was born. A secure platform for detecting counterfeits through imaging. We've pivoted a few times due to demand, but I think we are settling down in the  area where we are doing provenance.
* Launch IoT. Lots of good connections including meeting a friend of a friend coming from Malaysia (will visit next week). And another travelpreneur friend of mine from Korea (also going to catch up soon - so far with met in 3 different cities!).
* Chinese New Year for the first time in Hong Kong. Met a **TON** of connections from Hong Kong and abroad. This is going to make it hard to leave soon.
* Being pitched many ideas (thanks to startupweekend)
* Work Work Work on making the startup weekend project a reality. And ended up staying in Hong Kong longer than anticipated (missed out on this years Sydney Mardi Gras, and SXSW 2016). Always next year though I hope.
* Kicked off startup weekend in Shenzhen
* Passive income for some past projects trickling in (after some big projects funding dried up)
* Converting my bitcoin exchange API bindings to ruby gems
* Amazon Lambda and OpenCV
* Amazon Lambda in general (and trying to focus on static sites with javascript microservices)

## And now for the latest project
Which I might add, should interest nomads - [Where was I in the last 90 days](http://static.barryteoh.com/travel-stats.html) 

Sounds good? It's sure a rollercoaster - just like the prices of bitcoin

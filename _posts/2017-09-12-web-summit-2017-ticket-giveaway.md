Due much popular responses, I've decided to give away the ticket in the form of a cash bond and reverse auction.

## How does it work?

* You first make a bid for the ticket (pick a number between €80 and €150)
* Then you go to [**this link**](https://bn2snfmfz4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/1) to pay for the ticket (make sure you select EUR, and enter in the comments "Web Summit Ticket Bid"). In the payment form where it specifies, please include your email address so that I can contact your if your bid is unsuccessful so that I can return you your money, or if you win I can actually assign you your ticket (I'd hate not to be able to return free money ;-)).
* Wait will September 19th, the **lowest unique bid** wins the ticket. As long as you have sent me your email address, everyone will get their money returned to them as soon as possible (minus any transfer charges - so if you provide me a cryptocurrency address it would be cheaper!).
* The winner gets €50 back in CASH guaranteed (however, you may get more back depending on how you paid because in reality there are fees depending on how you paid).

I'm not too fussed about the money, the idea of the exercise is not to waste the ticket (you have to come to get the cash - sorry no transfers here :p).

### Why is the minimum bid more than € 50 ?

You'll find that the price is adjusted as close as possible to €50 for cryptocurrency payments.

I added extra padding to support other payment methods such as paypal which I prefer not to receive as its hard to get money out of paypal into physical cash without going through many steps.

Rest assured to repeat myself again I'm not in this for the money, and will return *ALL** funds (minus any fees).

layout: post
title: "New refresh again!"

While the old design was good, it wasn't really working on mobile devices properly.

Which looked a bit bad seeing this is a developer blog. So what's the solution? Make some changes to the template (and of course throw in a nice design onto this). The end result is this new layout!

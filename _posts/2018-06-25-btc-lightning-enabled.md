title: "Hello Bitcoin Lightning! ⚡️"
---

In case you haven't been keeping touch with the [bitcoin lightning world](http://lightning.network/) lately, I've been working on a few projects to get this blog (and also to support my own businesses) to accept bitcoin lightning payments.

If you take a look at the bottom of this post I've started allowing tips via the lightning network from a basic like (25 cents, through to sending me enough cash to get me a coffee or beer).

All made possible thanks to [this project](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/lightning-pay-page) which is uses my lightning API script (and rate grabbing tool). But I've included a fallback into this project in case you do not have lightning (and wish to use either normal BTC or another crypto).

As well as supporting my technology business, and hospitality business - I intend to formalize my crypto to fiat OTC offerings this way (the rates is based on a Thailand based exchange including covering for any fees (as well as liquidity), which is where I spend a lot of time - hence the fiat will come from there).

For those who need web design or development (wordpress / static sites), app design or development, UX design - yes we accept crypto. Please do [get in touch](http://t.me/nolim1t). 

For those who need to rent out rooms in Taipei, Taiwan on a long or short term basis, please do [get in touch](http://t.me/nolim1t)

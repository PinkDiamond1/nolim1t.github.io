Seems that I'm on the right track with 2022.

## So far

* Weening usage of 1Password.com and using VaultWarden (Rust version for Bitwarden)
* Running m0re full nodes (This time trying the [Bitcoin Knots](https://github.com/nolim1t/docker-bitcoinknots) implementation.)
* Continueing to promote the Sovereignty Meetup

## Focus

* Get off Dropbox and cloud documents
* Run more full nodes (bitcoin and otherwise non monetary. I hope to also use [C-Lightning](https://github.com/lncm/docker-clightning)'s implementation too for doing lightning nodes. I dig the plugin system a lot.)
* Focus on profitability (Running a business which self supports itself, and get back into the green) and sustainability (extra cash into long term things)


## Far fetched

* Get another passport. Likely St Kitts & Nevins because of residency requirements, but Portugal sounds cool for the EU.

title: "Hacking the messenger codes and snapcodes"
---

Recently I've just gotten my messenger code so I've been thinking, what is the best way of merging the two codes together.

I've first tried putting the messenger code within the snapcode itself. The results wasnt very good as the UX behind the scanning was a bit fiddly. Not good if you want this on your business card or contact card.

The next best solution?

I tried putting my snapcode within the messenger code itself - which works out better as snapchat is a camera app (so of course they need to do this properly). The result. My snapcode is within the messenger code. But this requires a bit of image editing.

Firstly, get rid of your photo from the messenger code.

Next, take your original photo and put it behind the snapcode background.

Then take your snapcode and put it within the messenger code circle.

title: "Hacktoberfest 2020 Opt-in Repo list"
---

As a supporter of open source and to help promote it, I've decided to [enable a few of the repos I maintain](https://nolim1t.co/hacktoberfest2020/) with
the `Hacktoberfest` tag.

You can find more details on how to participate [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

To keep things fair, please follow my contribution guidelines above.

I'm also accepting PRs for **any** of my repos that are not participating, however they cannot be spam pull requests and I need to approve you manually.

If you have made a pull request on any of my repo, please send me a DM on twitter / telegram or [contact me on discord](https://discord.gg/sN2c8H) and mention any details about it.

I will then assess if it should be included or not. Do not mention this in the pull request at all.

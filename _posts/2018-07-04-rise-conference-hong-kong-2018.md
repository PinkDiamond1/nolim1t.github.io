It's that time of year again. The last year in review professionally, I've been mostly doing my experimental stuff with tech and also contributing to some open source projects.

I've been so chilled out lately in my [jungle abode](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/travel/2018-06-11/lost-in-paradise.html) (but also sometimes head to the beach for some sun).

But time for a little bit more inspiration from techsauce and now ready for conference season again.

Anyway, the last few weeks have been getting some bits and pieces together (such a shiny crypto payment system together for micropayments and also tying in the trusty non-micropayments solution) now ready to get back in to it getting in some new work for the next year.

Originally I wasn't planning on heading to Hong Kong, but a last minute snap decision decided (with offer of free tickets), was to fly out there. Also as a bonus, the football is not screening most of RISE conference so I'll get a chance to be awake at a sane hour.

Anyway, here's my schedule during the conference for those who'd like to catch up.

But wait isn't RISE supposed to be 3 days? I decided to cut my trip short because of some family reasons (good to compromise on the work life balance hey?).

But for those who didn't get a chance to meet? I'll be in Taipei in late August, and possibly Korea in early September. And then probably over to Europe for a few blockchain conferences.

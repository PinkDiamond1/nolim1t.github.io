title: "Mid-2020 Year update from me"
---

It's been an interesting year this year. From the initial zombie apocalypse scare, the bitcoin halving, and a year where all conferences are cancelled.

Though some conferences have decided to do online only, I'm not going to attend those ones because its not the same. Certainly if I have to pay for them. To me conferences are for socializing and sharing a beer or meal together.

Anyway just a little update on what I've been doing:

* I've been continuing my development [making a better developer experience and building a better cross platform experience for several OSS projects related to bitcoin and privacy tech](https://github.com/lncm)
* I've been still pushing the reasons on why you should run a full node. Therefore, I've decided to volunteer some of my time also to the [Umbrel Project](https://github.com/getumbrel) which makes running a full node easy for people to do.
* I'm advocating use of privacy technologies - mainly Tor. Because it gives people the right to do whatever they like. You may find some of my curated [.onion links](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/onions-module) at that page. Feel free to create an issue if you want to add more.
* I'm still advocating decentralization. Because it makes things more robust. Not just running a full node, but hosting your own services too.
* I'm still trying to be as minimalist as possible. I'm careful of what I buy and would rather save in cool [savings technology](https://bitcoin.org/en/)

Over the next few months, I hope to do the following:

* Build on the Pine64 Phone (It's basically a pure Linux Phone, which an act as a desktop). Would be great to run a full node on there
* Continue contributing to various Open Source Projects
* Hope to have a saleable product / service in the pipeline soon based on the above (earn those sats!)

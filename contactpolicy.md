# Social Media Communications Policy

As I do get a lot of messages and requests please take the time to read this.

## Order of Messaging Priorities

* Facebook Messenger (Try to use secret chats)
* Wire Messenger
* Keybase
* Snapchat
* iMessage (I use MacOS)
* Twitter
* Telegram (Try to use secret chats, although they do suck) 
* Instagram
* Any other messengersi/services (LINE / WhatsApp)

## Reply / Follow / Add Policy

As messages can be overwhelming, I look for a lot of signals when I choose who to follow or reply to.

The biggest signal is **Authenticity** - Are you a real person. While I don't care if you don't use your real legal name. I do care if you are a real person. Do you have a completely filled in profile? Have I met you before? Please state this when introducing yourself in the first message. There are a lot of spammers, and if you come across as a spammer I will not reply to you.

Next is obviously the **content value** that you share. (Private profiles need not read further, I can't see any of it so not much of a signal here). Do you overshare (it can be annoying), or do you share good quality content.

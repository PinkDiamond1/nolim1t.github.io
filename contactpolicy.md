# Online/Social Media Communications Policy

As I do get a lot of messages and requests please take the time to read this.

## Order of Messaging Priorities

* Facebook Messenger (Try to use secret chats. Please INTRODUCE yourself.)
* Wire Messenger
* Email. You may contact hello @ this domain. However, please PGP Encrypt it with my [key](https://nolim1t.co/key/pgpkey.asc.txt) as a test that you are not a spammer.
* Keybase
* Snap
* Twitter
* iMessage (I use MacOS and iOS, but I'm trying to phase this off)
* Telegram (Try to use secret chats, although they do suck) 
* Any other messengersi/services (LINE / WhatsApp)

## Reply / Follow / Add Policy

As messages can be overwhelming, I look for a lot of signals when I choose who to follow or reply to.

The biggest signal is **Authenticity** - Are you a real person. While I don't care if you don't use your real legal name. I do care if you are a real person. Do you have a completely filled in profile? Have I met you before? Please state this when introducing yourself in the first message. There are a lot of spammers, and if you come across as a spammer I will not reply to you.

Next is obviously the **content value** that you share. (Private profiles need not read further, I can't see any of it so not much of a signal here). Do you overshare (it can be annoying), or do you share good quality content.

***NOTICE*** If you're in the business of promoting crypto shitcoins/ICOs (shitcoins is anything which doesn't follow the consensus rules - currently [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) ) or MLM/Network Marketing schemes, please do not bother contacting, or give another reason why I should reply.

And finally **account age**. If I see that you are a new account with barely any posts, it comes off as a spammer. See the authenticity part on how to improve points on getting a reply/add.

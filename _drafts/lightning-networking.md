title: "Lightning Networking"
---

In case you've seen, I've been getting balls deep into lightning network (layer 2 for bitcoin).

It's come a long way from its humble beginnings as a whitepaper in 2016, but started my journey hacking on various lightning network projects in 2018, much of it has become [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/).

I've taken a backseat / support role in keeping things patched while working on improving the payment flow for widescale adoption, as well as user testing.

While open for consultation for services who want to support this.

While supporting Monero which is the only non-bitcoin currency I like, I'm not a fan of others and want to support less of it.

All smart contract platforms seem to be concentrated to a pseudo anonymous account model, which is very bad for privacy.

While lightning network breaks the chain analysis, and hopefully layers above it do.

I'm also a fan of having a robust / simple / secure layer 1, equivalent of driving an armored truck around, while layer 2 and above are similar to day to day passenger commuter vehicles.

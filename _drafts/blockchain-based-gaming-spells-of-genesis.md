title: "Gaming on the blockchain"
---

In case you haven't heard what's on in the last few years - the blockchain is changing a lot of industries. First and foremost, banking. No longer do you need to trust a middleman to hold your money.

And in other industries, blockchain is useful for keeping tabs on assets without a middleman too.

But anyway, more on topic - gaming on the blockchain.

Where might this be useful?

As a gamer, you like to collect cool items (for example - in magic the gathering, getting rare cards, some worth thousands of dollars). But what if there was a way to digitally own these rare items without getting them duplicated (therefore destroying the rarity of it).

Anyway, there's a new game released on April 20th which uses the counterparty protocol to be able to own collectable cards. The game is called [Spells of Genesis](https://spellsofgenesis.com/), and available on iOS and Android.

I've given the game a try and it's interesting. As usual starts of slow, but then the difficulty and therefore strategy ramps up (and you probably need powerful cards to get past certain stages).

Where blockchain comes in handy in the game is you can link your blockchain address to your game account, so that you actually own the cards.

My recommended wallet is [IndiesquareWallet](https://wallet.indiesquare.me/), which is available for iOS and Android. There is a list of wallets you can choose from on the [counterparty](http://counterparty.io/counterparty-wallets/) site.

## Where can you buy cards?

There's two types of cards you can own in the game:

* Game cards
* Blockchain cards

The interesting thing about blockchain based cards is you can actually trade them on [SOG Assets](https://sogassets.com/) 's decentralized exchange exactly the same way as you would trade a blockchain token ([Instructions here](https://counterparty.io/docs/buy_and_sell_assets_on_the_dex/)).

And because the blockchain cards are tokens, you can probably trade with players too for either blockchain currency or if you like cash.

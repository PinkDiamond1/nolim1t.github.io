title: "On the leadup to RISE 2017"
---

I've been a conference veteran for many years - United States, Asia, and Europe.

I've been to South by Southwest from 2010 all the way through to 2015, RISE from 2015 up until now (this being the 3rd year), and Web Summit since 2016.

I've also attended Ruby Kaigi in Japan since 2011, but sadly I might have to give this year a miss due to timing (I'd love to visit Japan again!).

Anyway it's time for my pre-conference tips.

## Tips for preparation

* While in Europe, I didn't really care to give them out. Plus web summit has an awesome app to use. But In Asia, it's all about business cards. Always have them. Just your name and contact. For me it's my website portal. Have something that stands out which is also a good conversation starter, and something memorable. Some events you need a namecard to get in to them.
* If you're coming from out of town, arrive a few days before to allow time to adjust to the time zone. Also you might want to get business cards printed out in Hong Kong rather than carrying it there. You need to stay alert during AND after the conference - If you actually want to meet people, you need to be at the night events. I found the best connections were at night.
* There are lots of coworking spaces in Hong Kong. My favorite one is WeWork but it's quite expensive for the day. However if you have a WeWork community member you can use that. Try to time your day with the events they hold, but more importantly - don't get too drunk on the free bottomless beer they offer there or you won't be working.
* Check out some of the other events. HK is a very happening place.

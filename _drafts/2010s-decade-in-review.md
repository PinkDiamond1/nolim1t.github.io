title: "2010s decade in review - My journey"
---

I think the 2010s for me was all about all the fruits of the previous decade paying off, as well as experimentation and consolidation.

My 2010 saw myself a nice windfall which meant a short gap year through Europe and Asia to kick off my digital nomad journey.

I started building apps then because it sounded cool to make something that you could use on a mobile device. The market back then wasn't as saturated so the payouts were a lot better.  

My 2011 saw myself doing consulting for various firms who wanted in on the app industry which timing could not be impeccable. On the travel side, I also fell in love with Hong Kong.. so much that I actually missed my flight. Even have an old Hong Kong passport stamp (on an old passport) back when they were still stamping passports. In 2011, was also the year where I first discovered a thing called bitcoin. I didn't think of it much and it was not easy to learn about it but grateful that I actually did learn about it early.

2012 was a bit more similar. I did a few more Hong Kong back and forth trips just to see what it would be like living there, and also explore some of the nearby locales. Also the year which I started accumulating (and spending) bitcoins too (silkroad lol). Also decided to get back on the old startup trail as "SoLoMo" was the hot thing, and a few people pitched me this. I signed onto a startup to build a discovery platform but soon discovered that there was a bit of FOMO there and also due to some team issues, I did leave it after a couple of months.

2013 was going to be the year where I did make my move initially to the east (also to get away from some personal things too). Hong Kong I figured would make a good base because it has both familiar comforts and exotic stuff. I set up base initially in Wan Chai - a nice and central neighborhood. 

2014 was getting settled in to expat life, accumulating lots of bitcoins (and actually securing them properly). Also took part in the Ethereum crowdsale, and also the year which I unlocked China and South Korea. Those were very interesting places and I did find the culture fascinating. Especially the korean alphabet. And also beginning talks of formulating a business in the region.

2015 was more like 2014, but was building up another startup in Taipei. It saw me doing a lot of back and forth trips between Hong Kong and Taipei (with Korea thrown in).

2016 was when we realized that startup wasn't going to be viable as it was heavily coupled with another business (brick and morter business) which encountered some "local issues". But also formed another startup based on a win at startup weekend so was focusing on that for a couple of months. Due to visa issues in Hong Kong, I spent a lot of time in South Korea / Taiwan / Phillipines / San Francisco. I actually kicked off my [travel & food blog](https://itinerantfoodie.com/) around then. And because I had over a million frequent flier miles accumulated as well as the highest tier on Cathay Pacific, I did right a few reviews on the lounges. 2016, was the first year I went to Web Summit in Portugal too. And I ended 2016 in South East Asia (Thailand / Vietnam / Cambodia / Myanmar). On the bitcoin/ethereum side, kept on accumulating and also sold most of my ethereum  for ethereum classic (lol) so I did miss most of the big 2017 ETH run-up. (no lambos)

2017 was the year I realized that if Hong Kong wasn't going to work out, South East Asia appears to be the next hotspot, as I soon discovered a community of remote workers. There was (and still is) a lot of temptation because its full of "gap year backpackers" and "full moon parties" which initially made it very easy to not be productive, but it seems ripe with many opportunities to build stuff and also having a nice serviced apartment sub $300 was a very good drawcard. I continued to more transient lifestyle in 2017, including an [epic land road trip](https://itinerantfoodie.com/post/tripreport/2017-10-30/the-road-to-websummit.html) from Northern Europe to Southern Europe over the course of 2 months. The key take is I actually got some good connections out of Europe and also figured the Asia and Europe time zones are very similar. 

2018 I did not travel too much initially ("shitcoin and ICO hangover"), but bunkered down and explored more on the tech side of things (bitcoin / lightning network). I wanted to have a payment platform which I can easily plug into any business and get validation without asking banks for permission to operate. Banks can be a big buzzkill sometimes for entrepreneurs. I also unlocked Bali in 2018 before ending the final days back in  Thailand.

2019 was a bit more like 2018, but even less travelling (just the essentials and extended visa runs (1 month+) .. as someone I met in Ho Chi Minh City calls "Visa walks"). Also continued building stuff with lightning network to make it easy for any business to use. Also the year where I might get some return on one of my 2016 startup investments from Hong Kong. Not big but its better than 0. I also did a lot of research on transient lifestyles and minimalism because in 2019 (and 2018) was the year where a there seems to be a lot of visa headaches so next time I'll be ready for it. 

## Moving foward

* More mobile / flexible / minimal (consume less) / sustainable lifestyle. Actually researching more options on working off a tablet.
* Try to build businesses around the above.

## Summary

* One startup exit
* App development (independent and as a consultant)
* Two failed startups
* One moderatly ok exit (to be finalized still)
* Bitcoin still strong and growing
* Bought and lost money in shitcoins and ICOs (moral of the story: Bitcoin not blockchain)
* Improve on minimalism, and mobility/freedom

Another Ruby Kaigi 2016, came and gone. This is one reason I love being a rubist - Because, I get to do an annual trip to Japan.

This year it was held in Kyoto. One of my First visits to the city. The conference being hosted in Kyoto was a blessing as I got to actually dedicate some time out to travel to Kyoto.

### Day 0

The first day, I decided to do some exploring of the city's attractions and trying some of the local delicacies.

Of course a trip to Kyoto (especially the first time), isn't complete without visiting stuff such as:

* Kinkaku-ji or the Golden Temple
* Kiyomizu-dera Temple (Perfect for the sunset)

The weather for the first day was perfect, until the evening then the Typhoon type weather started. But then most of the trip would be spent indoors.

### Day 1

It's showtime. Here are the highlights

#### Ruby Kaigi Keynote


##### Ruby 3

* Performance
* Concurrency
* Typing

###### Typing in Ruby (by Matz)

Matz discusses that static Typed language in Ruby 3 would be a possibility to follow the footsteps of Swift, Go, TypeScript. However technology is like a pendulum - it goes back and forth.

He also discusses that hot languages went from non-staticly typed, to staticly typed, but it might come back again so maybe Ruby 3 will remain dynamic typed.

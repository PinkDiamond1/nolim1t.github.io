Over the last few days I've been busy setting up my OÜ (Short for Osaühing which means "limited company") in Estonia.

I've always been facinated by the technology and got to see it in action while setting up the company.

Here are some of the cool points I've noticed so far:

* All paperwork and contracts are electronic. You just insert in your card reader, then ID card and sign the document. This is the best feature ever. No need to worry about couriering documents and wasting paper. It's more eco-friendly.
* It's awesome if you don't have a fixed address but still have the means of making money through your company.
* You can use the ID card to authenticate with many of the Estonian government websites or banking sites (yay for NOT remembering yet another password or shitty password policies). This is the technology part I'm definitely interested in.
* You have a personal eesti.ee email address issued to yourself and also one for the company that you have registered. It's gotta be better than GMAIL (I've had issues with GMAIL in the past)
* Setup for the company (assuming no trademarks or similar names), is done and entered into the registry within 24-48 hours.
* Assuming no issues, EU business bank account set up within 1 week but you need to be in Tallinn for this.
* Money left in the company is NOT TAXED, also if you're an investor type money injected into the Estonian economy by investments is also NOT TAXED (finally someone gets it right, the spice must flow!). You are only taxed on taking money out of the company as a dividend or income. Business expenses (bank fees, business support, travel expenses, Uber, Taxi and coworking space rental) are NOT taxed - this is huge because as a remote worker my living expenses is tax free.


## Technology

Now on to the fun part. This was the sole reason why I got into the program. I was more interested with the tech behind the scenes (implementing ID card login for websites).

When I'm a bit more free, I'll be building some proof of concept stuff based on the Eesti-ID (maybe even find a way of tying it in with Blockstack or an easy way of generating a bitcoin wallet)

Also the way of digitally signing documents which is as good as paper.

## Estonia in General

* Cost of Living wise it is about 10-15% more expensive than Chiang Mai.
* Similar living expenses as Taiwan
* More english than Chiang Mai or Taiwan
* Close to UK (for conferences)
* Internet access is considered a human right (I love that)
* Similar weather to Canada (Doesn't get warmer than 20 degrees in Summer!)

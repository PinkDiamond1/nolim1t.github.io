Over the last few days I've been busy setting up my legal entity in Estonia (which is my gateway to the EU).

Here are some of the cool points I've noticed so far:

* All paperwork and contracts are electronic. You just insert in your card reader, then ID card and sign the document. This is the best feature ever. No need to worry about couriering documents and wasting paper. It's more eco-friendly.
* It's awesome if you don't have a fixed address (i.e. Homeless) but still have the means of making money through your company.
* You can use the ID card to authenticate with many of the Estonian government websites or banking sites (yay for NOT remembering yet another password or shitty password policies). This is the technology part I'm definitely interested in.
* You have a personal eesti.ee email address issued to yourself (and also one for the company that you have registered). It's gotta be better than GMAIL (I've had issues with GMAIL in the past)
* Setup for the company (assuming no trademarks or similar names), is done and entered into the registry within 24-48 hours.
* Assuming no issues, EU business bank account set up within 1 week but you need to be in Tallinn for this.
* Money left in the company is NOT TAXED. You are only taxed on taking money out of the company (as a dividend an income). Therefore you can spend money as the company.

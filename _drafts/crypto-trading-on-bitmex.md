title: "Leverage crypto trading on BitMex"
---

Recently, I've been doing a bit of crypto trading with altcoins and also bitcoin.

I first got my first taste of trading on Poloniex where I used to open positions against ethereum (after the hard fork).

Poloniex is not too bad, but after I gave BitMex a try - it seems that their platform is a bit more mature. Also the charting on the platform is so much more superior.

## Lessons Learnt doing leverage trading

* If you're highly leveraged, don't forget to set a "stop loss" order (especially trading late at night, you snooze you lose literally). That way you don't loose everything when the market goes the other way.
* Experiment with smaller orders
* Trend is your friend. Look at the charts and news. Also check out the only trading chats on telegram for tips.

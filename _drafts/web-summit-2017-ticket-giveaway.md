Due much popular responses, I've decided to give away the ticket in the form of a cash bond and reverse auction.

## How does it work?

* You first make a bid for the ticket (pick a number between €80 and €150)
* Then you go to [**this link**](https://bn2snfmfz4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/1) to pay for the ticket. Please include your email address so that I can contact your if your bid is unsuccessful so that I can return you your money.
* Wait will September 19th, the **lowest unique bid** wins the ticket. As long as you have sent me your email address, everyone will get their money returned to them as soon as possible (minus any transfer charges - so if you provide me a cryptocurrency address it would be cheaper!).
* The winner gets €50 back in CASH guaranteed (however, you may get more back depending on how you paid because in reality there are fees depending on how you paid).

I'm not too fussed about the money, the idea of the exercise is not to waste the ticket (so I will give you some cash or we meet up in Lisbon and buy you dinner or maybe even put it towards a shared airbnb accommodation).

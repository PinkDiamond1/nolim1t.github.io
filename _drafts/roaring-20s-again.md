Happy new year all readers. 

We're now a new year and decade and now the roaring 20s again.

Thought I might lay it out what my plans are this decade.

## Try to be bitcoin (only)

It will definetely be building around bitcoin tech. Mostly second layer or above (?!).

We are in an age where the trading amongst the Internet is a norm.
There's a lot of barriers at the moment with the tradition banking system.
Bureacracy and so on, and then they get to decide if you do business or not, or continue to do business.

As an entrepreneur I feel it's unacceptable that businesses are subject to whims of banks. And I think its time to say enough is enough when being bullied by banks (I've had 2 accounts closed in 2019, almost had one of the main ones closed but because the main one affected their bottom line they actually gave some workarounds).

So I want to see myself supporting this space - working on similar projects to break down this barrier and support small businesses. Any fintech project I will be reluctant to support.

## Programming Languages

I want to improve on golang and rust. 

They seem nice languages to do. Golang seems to have sane package management (just git repos). And also are binary based.

Rust looks promising too but need to read up more on this. The language looks similar to Go as in it builds binaries.

## Privacy/Anonymous Technology

Another hot topic is privacy and anonymity. I think people should be able to speak freely without any adverse actions. It's a fundamental human right to be able to speak out.

## Decentralization

Also decentralization is another idea of mine. Not being tied so heavily to one country is what I like, as countries start enforcing/tightening down their borders. I'd like to be able to stay in various hubs around the world and share tips on how to do this. 

This means working remotely and being an extreme minimalist.

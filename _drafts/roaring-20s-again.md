Happy new year all readers. 

We're now a new year and decade and now the roaring 20s again.

Thought I might lay it out what my plans are this decade.

## Bitcoin (only)

It will definetely be building around bitcoin tech. Mostly second layer or above (?!).

We are in an age where the trading amongst the Internet is a norm.
There's a lot of barriers at the moment with the tradition banking system.
Bureacracy and so on, and then they get to decide if you do business or not, or continue to do business.

As an entrepreneur I feel it's unacceptable that businesses are subject to whims of banks. 

So I want to see myself supporting this space - working on similar projects to break down this barrier and support small businesses.

## Programming Languages

I want to improve on golang and rust. 

They seem nice languages to do. Golang seems to have sane package management (just git repos). And also are binary based.

Rust looks promising too but need to read up more on this. The language looks similar to Go as in it builds binaries.

## Privacy/Anonymous Technology

Another hot topic is privacy and anonymity. I think people should be able to speak freely without any adverse actions. It's a fundamental human right to be able to speak out.

## Decentralization

Also decentralization is another idea of mine. I'd like to be able to stay in various hubs around the world and share tips on how to do this.

This means working remotely and being an extreme minimalist.

# My "opt-in" Hacktoberfest 2020 Repositories

Here are a list and description of my hacktoberfest repos. The general theme is improving bitcoin second layer and usability.


* [**LND Unlock Docker Container**](https://github.com/lncm/docker-lnd-unlock) - A container that helps with unlocking of the [Lightning Network Daemon (go implementation)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) software. This works in conjunction with the [LND Docker container](https://github.com/lncm/docker-lnd) (not a participant in hackoberfest, but I can tag you if you make a useful pull request)
* [**The Box compose framework**](https://github.com/lncm/thebox-compose-system) - A docker-compose orchestration framework for spawning bitcoind/lnd/tor and a basic invoicer. 
* [**LND Neutrino switcher**](https://github.com/lncm/docker-lnd-neutrino-switch) - A container which automates the process of switching from LND Neutrino mode to LND Bitcoind mode
* [**Specter Desktop container**](https://github.com/lncm/docker-specter-desktop) - A container which enscapulates [Specter Desktop](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-desktop) server inside a docker container.

## Contribution Guidelines

In order to keep things fair, along with contribution guidelines in each repo.

* Please fill in as much information as possible outlining the purpose of the change. Pull requests without a description will be marked as `INVALID` immediately, and will not count.
* Please test out your change and try to show proof of this.
* Documentation changes are indeed valid within reason, as long as it suspiciously doesn't look like you are trying to increment your count.
